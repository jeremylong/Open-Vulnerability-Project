# vulnz cli

The cli is a spring-boot command line tool built with picocli. The example
below does run the setup - which creates both the `vulnz` symlink (in `/usr/local/bin`)
and a completion script. If using zsh, the completion will be added to 
`/etc/bash_completion.d` or `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d` (depending
on if they exist); see [permanently installing completion](https://picocli.info/autocomplete.html#_installing_completion_scripts_permanently_in_bashzsh)
for more details. We may add a brew formula in the future.

After running `install` you may need to restart your shell for the completion to work.

```bash
$ ./gradlew build
$ cd vulnz/build/libs
$ ./vulnz-1.0.0.jar install
$ vulnz cve --cveId CVE-2021-44228 --prettyPrint
```

Example of using the CLI with an API key stored in [1password](https://1password.com/) using
the `op` CLI (see [getting started with op](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/)):

```bash
export NVD_API_KEY=op://vaultname/nvd-api/credential
eval $(op signin)
op run -- vulnz cve --threads 4 > cve-complete.json
```
