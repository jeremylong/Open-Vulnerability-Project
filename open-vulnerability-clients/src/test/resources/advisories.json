Given Flood is granted access to rTorrent's SCGI interface (which is unprotected and ALLOWS arbitrary code execution) and usually wide-ranging privileges to files, along with Flood's lack of security controls against authenticated users, the severity of this vulnerability is **CRITICAL**. \n\n### Background\nCommit 8d11640b imported `config.js` to client (frontend) components to get `disableUsersAndAuth` configuration variable. Subsequently contents of `config.js` are compiled into static assets and served to users. Unfortunately `config.js` also includes `secret`.\n\nIntruders can use `secret` to sign authentication tokens themselves to bypass builtin access control of Flood.\n\n### Patches\nCommit 042cb4ce removed imports of `config.js` from client (frontend) components. Additionally an eslint rule was added to prevent config.js from being imported to client (frontend) components.\n\nCommit 103f53c8 provided a general mitigation to this kind of problem by searching static assets to ensure `secret` is not included before starting server (backend). \n\n### Workarounds\nUsers shall upgrade if they use Flood's builtin authentication system.\n\nWhile maintainers will do their best to support it, Flood cannot guarantee its in-house access control system can stand against determined attackers in high-stake environments. \n\n> Use `HTTP Basic Auth` or other battle-hardened authentication methods instead of Flood's in-house one. You can use `disableUsersAndAuth` to avoid duplicate authentication.\n\nUsers are advised to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki) for more information on security precautions.\n\n### References\n[Wiki - Security precautions](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki/Security-precautions)\n\n[Introduction to JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [issue tracker](https://github.com/jesec/flood/issues)\n* Email us at [jc@linux.com](mailto:jc@linux.com)",

Reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions and a lack of root session validation enabled attackers to resolve a user session attached to a different previously authenticated user.\n\nThis issue most affects users of shared computers. Suppose a user logs out of their account (without clearing their cookies) in a mobile app or similar client that includes the `offline_access` scope, and another user authenticates to the application. In that case, it will share the same root session id, and when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued a token for the original user.",

A Dask cluster created using this method AND running on a machine that has these ports exposed could be used by a sophisticated attacker to enable remote code execution. Users running on machines with standard firewalls in place, or using clusters created via cluster objects other than `LocalCluster` (e.g. `dask_kubernetes.KubeCluster`) should not be affected. This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2021-42343, and was fixed in version `2021.10.0` (PR #5427).",

Please upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds available.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Harbor GitHub repository](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to [Gal Goldstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gal-goldshtein/) and [Daniel Abeles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-abeles/) from [Oxeye Security](https://www.oxeye.io/) for reporting this issue.\n",
