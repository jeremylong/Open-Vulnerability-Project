# open-vulnerability-store

The open-vulnerability-store is an experimental project to build a database containing a normalized
set of vulnerability information. Currently, the library can be used to create a database of the
GitHub Security Advisories, NVD CVE data, the CISA Known Expoited Vulnerabilities Catalog, and EPSS.
